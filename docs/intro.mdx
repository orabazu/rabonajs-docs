# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **RabonaJS in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new pitch**. Aim of this library is to help you to create a pitch or a football field with JS.
The central class of the API is Rabona. It is used to create a pitch.

```js
import Rabona from "rabonajs";

const pitchOptions = {
  height: 80, //px
  width: 120, //px
  padding: 100, //px
  linecolour: "#ffffff",
  fillcolour: "#7ec850",
};

// initialize the pitch on the "pitch" div with a given options
const pitch = Rabona.pitch("pitch", pitchOptions);
```

```html
<div id="pitch"></div>
```
Providing a default options and a div to inject that's all you need to create a pitch! 🏟


## An example with React

You can use a **useRef** hook to get the DOM element in which you're going to inject the pitch.
We are keeping the pitch status in a state variable. We are using the **useEffect** hook to initialize the pitch.
We need provide a default style to the pitch div as well.

```jsx
import Rabona from "rabonajs";
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";

export const PitchComponent = () => {
  const [pitch, setPitch] = useState(null);
  const pitchRef = useRef(null);

  const pitchOptions = {
    height: 80, //in px
    width: 120, //in px
    padding: 100, // in px, distance between the pitch border lines and external border
    linecolour: "#ffffff",
    fillcolour: "#7ec850",
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!pitch) {
      const pitch = Rabona.pitch("pitch", pitchOptions);
      setPitch(pitch);
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <div id="pitch" ref={pitchRef} style={{ width: "500px", margin: "auto" }} />
  );
};
```

import Rabona from "rabonajs";
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";

export const PitchComponent = () => {
  const [pitch, setPitch] = useState(null);
  const pitchRef = useRef(null);
  const pitchOptions = {
    height: 80, //px
    width: 120, //px
    padding: 100, //px
    linecolour: "#ffffff",
    fillcolour: "#7ec850",
  };
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!pitch) {
      const pitch = Rabona.pitch("pitch", pitchOptions);
      setPitch(pitch);
    }
  }, []);
  return (
    <div id="pitch" ref={pitchRef} style={{ width: "500px", margin: "auto" }} />
  );
};

<PitchComponent />
