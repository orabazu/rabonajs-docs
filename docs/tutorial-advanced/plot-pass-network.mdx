# Creating a pass network using DanfoJS and RabonaJS

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a pass network using DanfoJS and RabonaJS.
 We will be using the [StatsBomb open dataset](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data) for this tutorial.

## Introduction

A pass network is a graph that shows the passing relationships between players in a football match. 
It is a useful tool for analyzing the passing patterns of a team and the players involved in the passing sequences.
It can also be used to identify the players who are most involved in the passing sequences.

## Prerequisites

Even though we are going to explain the code in detail, 
it could be nice to have a look at the [Danfo documentation](https://danfo.jsdata.org/). It is the replacement of 
pandas in JS ecosystem with a similar syntax. 

## Getting started

We will be using the [StatsBomb open dataset](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data/blob/master/data/matches/2/44.json) for this tutorial. 
The dataset we are going to use contains data for all the matches played by Arsenal in the famouse 2003-2004 season.
The invincible season in which Arsenal won the Premier League without losing a single match.

First we will import the required libraries and draw an empty pitch using RabonaJS.

```jsx
import Rabona from "rabonajs";
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";

export const ShotsComponent = () => {
  const [pitch, setPitch] = useState(null);

  const pitchOptions = {
    height: 80, //in px
    width: 120, //in px
    padding: 100, // in px, distance between the pitch border lines and external border
    linecolour: "#ffffff",
    fillcolour: "#7ec850",
  };
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!pitch) {
      const pitch = Rabona.pitch("pitch", pitchOptions);
      setPitch(pitch);
    }
  }, []);
  return <div id="pitch" style={{ width: "750px", margin: "auto" }} />;
};

```


import Rabona from "rabonajs";
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";

export const PassNetworks = () => {
  const [pitch, setPitch] = useState(null);
  // generate random shot data
  const pitchOptions = {
    height: 80, //in px
    width: 120, //in px
    padding: 100, // in px, distance between the pitch border lines and external border
    linecolour: "#ffffff",
    fillcolour: "#7ec850",
  };
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!pitch) {
      const pitch = Rabona.pitch("pitch", pitchOptions);
      setPitch(pitch);
    }
  }, []);
  return <div id="pitch" style={{ width: "750px", margin: "auto" }} />;
};

<PassNetworks/>

## Loading the data

Let's create a dropdown menu to select the match we want to analyze. 

```jsx

export const MatchSelector = ({ onChange }) => {
  const [matches, setMatches] = useState([]); 
  /*
  Here we are fetching the data from github. Any provided competitionId and seasonId will work.
  */
  const getData = async () => {
    const competitionId = 2; // premier league
    const seasonId = 44; // 2003-2004 season
    const matchesResponse = await fetch(
      'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statsbomb/open-data/master/data/matches/' +
        competitionId +
        '/' +
        seasonId +
        '.json',
    );
    const matches = await matchesResponse.json();
    setMatches(matches);
  };

  /*
    Load the data once the component is mounted
  */
  useEffect(() => {
    getData();
  }, []);


  /*
    Render the dropdown menu
  */
  return (
    <div>
      <select onChange={onChange}>
        {matches.map((match) => (
          <option key={match.match_id} value={match.match_id}>
            {match.home_team.home_team_name} {match.home_score} - {match.away_score} {match.away_team.away_team_name}
          </option>
        ))}
      </select>
    </div>
  );
};

```

### MatchSelector Component

using `onChange` function we can get the selected match id to retrieve the data for that match.\
That will just the log the match id for now.

export const MatchSelector = ({ onChange }) => {
  const [matches, setMatches] = useState([]); 
  // fetch data from github 
  const getData = async () => {
    const competitionId = 2; // premier league
    const seasonId = 44; // 2003-2004 season
    const matchesResponse = await fetch(
      'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statsbomb/open-data/master/data/matches/' +
        competitionId +
        '/' +
        seasonId +
        '.json',
    );
    const matches = await matchesResponse.json();
    setMatches(matches);
  };
  useEffect(() => {
    getData();
  }, []);
  // render the dropdown menu
  return (
    <div>
      <select onChange={onChange}>
        {matches.map((match) => (
          <option key={match.match_id} value={match.match_id}>
            {match.home_team.home_team_name} {match.home_score} - {match.away_score} {match.away_team.away_team_name}
          </option>
        ))}
      </select>
    </div>
  );
};

<MatchSelector onChange={(e) => console.log(e.target.value)} />
